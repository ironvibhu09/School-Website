To me, being able to make contributions to education is a very noble mission.
<br>
I believe that our children are our future. In order to secure this bright future we have to understand the need to groom our children towards building them to be entrepreneur and innovators.
<br>
My young Podarites, the Future is now and we at Lilavatibai Podar will do our best to equip you for your journey ahead!
<br>
At Lilavatibai Podar High School, we strive for excellence in all forms. Whether it is teaching, conducting activities or creating learning experience, the school has always been the one to set the benchmark. Lilavatibai Podar creates holistic learning experiences for every learner to prepare them to carve their niche on a global platform. Every student of Lilavatibai Podar is a future leader, entrepreneur, sports personality, teacher, academic researcher, scientist, inventor, stand - up comic, actor… the possibilities are endless. We aim to provide our learners with a multitude of opportunities that will help them discover new possibilities and pathways for their life’s journey. As educators, we are mere facilitators who aid our young learners figure out the realities of life along with complex concepts.
<br>
It is rightly said, “Excellence is never by accident. It is always a result of commitment, intelligent planning and focused effort.” and LPHS exemplifies that. With exemplary teaching practices, a thoughtfully designed curriculum richly embedded with hands-on activities as well as use of technology that makes learning enriching and meaningful, Lilavatibai Podar is unmatched in the experience it offers students.
