    The Educational Complex was founded under the inspiration of Late Shri Pithashree Anandilal Podar in 1927 as a small exclusive school, for all those who love their children and want to impart quality education.

    In 1930, Mahatma Gandhi and Mr. Jamnalal Bajaj, owing to their political pre-occupation, retired from the Trusteeship of the Society, and Mr. Madan Mohan Malviya became the President of the Society, till his demise in 1946. Thereafter, the Society was guided by Raja Ramdeo Anandilal Podar.

                The only thing constant in life is ‘Change’. Our educational existence since 1987 and its historic legacy, has been an incredible journey in nurturing academic talent and hone life’s skills in every student for a life ahead of their schooling years. At LPHS we take responsibility to encourage our students to dream big by reminding them to be risk takers and never limit themselves because of other’s limited imagination. Our endevour has always been to work in partnership that will positively impact our student’s academic, social and emotional development helping us to Educate, Enlighten and Empower the students.

Planned, age appropriate workshops are conducted regularly, Topics on Gender sensitivity, Internet etiquette and responsible use of social media, Sensitivity and service to the community, Self-study habits are addressed.
<br><br>
To influence and impact our students learning, it is a culture at LPHS to invite our alumni to speak to our students of their experiences from their varied professional backgrounds.
